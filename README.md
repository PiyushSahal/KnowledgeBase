# Knowledge Base 
This knowledge base is a collection of documentation that typically includes answers to frequently asked questions, how-to guides, and troubleshooting instructions. Its purpose is to make it easy for people to find solutions to their problems without having to ask for help.
The idea behind this knowledge base is to provide users basic knowledge of the products like Yammer, SharePoint , OneDrive, Power Apps and Streams.

This is to help the users with basic inputs on how to use all the apps hosted in O365 environments. 

What is Yammer?
Yammer is a social networking tool to openly connect and engage across your organization; think of it as the Facebook of Microsoft. It integrates with the apps and services you already use through Office 365. Yammer helps you connect and engage across your organization, so you can discuss ideas, share updates, and network with others around the globe.

What is One Drive?
OneDrive is an Internet-based storage platform with a significant chunk of space offered for free by Microsoft to anyone with a Microsoft account. Think of it as a hard drive in the cloud, which you can share, with a few extra benefits thrown in. One of the primary benefits: OneDrive hooks into Windows 10.
